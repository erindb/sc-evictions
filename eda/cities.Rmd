## __q6__

Why is the number of evictions a double rather than an integer?!

> While other units of geography are all connected (block groups, census tracts, counties, etc.), place boundaries are separateâ€”requiring evictions to be aggregated and estimated differently. In many cases, the estimates of eviction are non-whole numbers (e.g., 0.4, 31.5, 100.6). (from [FAQ](https://evictionlab.org/help-faq/#less-than-one-eviction))

Which South Carolina city had the most evictions in 2016?

```{r}
most_evictions <- df %>%
  drop_na(evictions) %>%
  arrange(desc(evictions))
most_evictions
```

`r most_evictions$name[[1]]` had the most evictions in 2016 out of all South Carolina cities with recorded numbers of evictions.
